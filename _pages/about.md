I'm a **Computer Science student at Georgia Tech** (graduating Dec 2025) passionate about building the resilient, automated systems that power modern software. I'm drawn to cloud and DevOps because I believe the future of innovation lies in creating efficient, scalable infrastructure that allows developers to build without limits. My goal is to engineer the backbone of tomorrow's technology.

# 💼 Experience

At the **Georgia Tech Research Institute**, I first joined as a **Cloud Engineer Intern** in May 2024. In that role, I developed automation tools using Python and AWS Lambda that **cut cloud infrastructure costs by $15,000 each year**. I also designed a cross-platform testing framework that reduced test cycles by more than two hours per run, **saving an additional $50,000 annually**.  

After a year as a cloud engineer intern, I transitioned to a new team as a **DevOps Engineer Intern**, where I focused on automation and deployment workflows. I built multi-environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) deployment pipelines for over **10 microservices** using **Kubernetes, Rancher, and GitLab CI/CD**. I also integrated SAST and DAST security testing directly into the pipelines, **reducing critical pre-production vulnerabilities by 90%**.  

At the **Autonomous Connected Transportation (ACT) Laboratory**, I’ve worked as a **Research Assistant** on and off since January 2024. My focus there has been on real-time driver safety monitoring, where I built algorithms capable of processing sensor and vision data at **60 fps**. I also developed a Unity-based HMI application that improved data analysis efficiency for researchers by an estimated **25%**.

# 🎮 Projects I’m Proud Of

One of my favorite projects is the **Spotify Wrapped Replica**, a full-stack Android application that re-created Spotify’s “Wrapped” experience. I pitched the idea as a semester project, **led a six-person team as Scrum Master**, and designed the backend with REST APIs and Firebase. The most rewarding part was watching people see their listening history come to life as colorful, shareable stories.  

Another project I’m especially proud of is the **Emulated GBA Puzzle Game**. I programmed it entirely in C, working within tight constraints like memory-mapped I/O and DMA optimization to achieve real-time performance. Find out more details about it in the portfolio tab. To make it even more fun, I made sure it could be played online through the browser — you can try it here: **[Play the game](https://gbagt.org/gallery/player.html?project=Ink%20Link)**.

I also built a **DOOM-style 3D game** using Python and Pygame. The project involved writing a **ray-casting engine from scratch**, creating AI-driven enemy behaviors, and even generating levels dynamically. It was equal parts math, art, and problem-solving, and it gave me a much deeper appreciation for how early 3D games worked.

# 🎨 Campus Engagement

At Georgia Tech, I’m an active member of **VGDev**, the student-run video game development club. I’ve collaborated with other students on several projects, including *Epitaph*, a rogue-like action game. My main contributions were in art and visual design, helping shape the game’s aesthetic and creating assets to support the team’s vision. It was a reminder that building software isn’t just about the code — it’s also about storytelling and collaboration.
