I’m a **Computer Science student at Georgia Tech** (graduating Dec 2025) who loves turning tough engineering problems into clean, scalable software solutions. Most recently, I’ve been diving deep into **cloud automation** and **DevOps**, but I also have a creative streak for App/game development and fun side projects.

# 💼 Experience

At the **Georgia Tech Research Institute**, I first joined as a **Cloud Engineer Intern** in May 2024. In that role, I developed automation tools using Python and AWS Lambda that cut cloud infrastructure costs by about **$15,000 each year**. I also designed a cross-platform testing framework that reduced test cycles by more than two hours per run, saving an additional **$50,000 annually**.  

After a year as a cloud engineer intern, I transitioned to a new team as a **DevOps Engineer Intern** at a new team, where I focused on automation and deployment workflows. I built multi-environment deployment pipelines for both Java web apps and an internal LLM service using Kubernetes, Rancher, and GitLab CI/CD. I also integrated SAST and DAST security testing directly into the pipelines, ensuring vulnerabilities were caught early in the development process.  

At the **Autonomous Connected Transportation (ACT) Laboratory**, I’ve worked as a **Research Assistant** on and off since January 2024. My focus there has been on real-time driver safety monitoring, where I built algorithms capable of processing sensor and vision data at 60 fps. I also developed a Unity-based HMI application that made it easier for researchers to collect and visualize telemetry data in a user-friendly way.

# 🎮 Projects I’m Proud Of

One of my favorite projects is the **Spotify Wrapped Replica**, a full-stack Android application that re-created Spotify’s “Wrapped” experience. I pitched the idea as a semester project, led a six-person team as Scrum Master, and designed the backend with REST APIs and Firebase. On the frontend, I built parts of the Android Studio interface. The most rewarding part was watching people see their listening history come to life as colorful, shareable stories.  

Another project I’m especially proud of is the **Emulated GBA Puzzle Game**. I programmed it entirely in C for a Game Boy Advance emulator, working within tight constraints like memory-mapped I/O and DMA optimization. To make it even more fun, I made sure it could be played online through the browser — you can try it here: [Play the game](https://gbagt.org/gallery/player.html?project=Ink%20Link).  

I also built a **DOOM-style 3D game** using Python and Pygame. The project involved writing a ray-casting engine from scratch, creating AI-driven enemy behaviors, adding animations, and even generating levels dynamically. It was equal parts math, art, and problem-solving, and it gave me a much deeper appreciation for how early 3D games worked.

# 🎨 Campus Engagement

At Georgia Tech, I’m an active member of **VGDev**, the student-run video game development club. I’ve collaborated with other students on several projects, including *Epitaph*, a rogue-like action game. My main contributions were in art and visual design, helping shape the game’s aesthetic and creating assets to support the team’s vision. It was a reminder that building software isn’t just about the code — it’s also about storytelling and collaboration.
